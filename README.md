# MOD5-Task-Board---3rd-Party-APIs
Create a simple task board/kanban board application

## Description

For this week’s project I was given the starter code that would display an a simple task board / kanban board application when finished. This will allow a team to manage project tasks. We have to modify the starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

- My main motivation for this project was to see how well I knew how to use third-party API as well as Jquery, Bootstrap and Dayjs. 
- I built this project to test my knowledge on how much I have learned. I spent 3 days last week reviewing API's, Jquery, and bootstrap before starting on this project. 
- This project solves the problem of being able to track your tasks without needing something like Google calender or an email calendar.
- I learned that even something that seemed fairly simple can be still be quite complicated.
- My biggest challenge this week was time management. I've had a very busy week with appointments so I could retire from the Military on Wednesday and wasn't able to work on this till today.

## User Story

```md
AS A project team member with multiple tasks to organize
I WANT a task board 
SO THAT I can add individual project tasks, manage their state of progress and track overall project progress accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a task board to manage a project
WHEN I open the task board
THEN the list of project tasks is displayed in columns representing the task progress state (Not Yet Started, In Progress, Completed)
WHEN I view the task board for the project
THEN each task is color coded to indicate whether it is nearing the deadline (yellow) or is overdue (red)
WHEN I click on the button to define a new task
THEN I can enter the title, description and deadline date for the new task into a modal dialog
WHEN I click the save button for that task
THEN the properties for that task are saved in localStorage
WHEN I drag a task to a different progress column
THEN the task's progress state is updated accordingly and will stay in the new column after refreshing
WHEN I click the delete button for a task
THEN the task is removed from the task board and will not be added back after refreshing
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved tasks persist
```

## Installation

There are no special installation steps for this project. All you need to do is clone the repository from GitHub onto your computer.

## Usage

Once you have it in your local repository, on your computer, you can use Visual Studio Code to open the folder. Then you will see the JavaScript.js (currently with my pseudo-code notes in the top half) the index.html, the style.css and other associated files. You can then review the files, preview the script.js, style.css, and the index.html, and then open the index.html in a browser. Click on “Add Employees” to build your own tracker.
